# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview 
The goal of this project is to create an interactive map to visualize the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the past week. 

### This project was created with the following technology
1. Leaflet.js (JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps)
  - Leaflet in combination with [Mapbox API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/overview/) was use for interactive visualizlation 
2. GeoJSON (A format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures)

3. D3.js (A JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS)
